export const SOP_PROMPT = String.raw`You are an expert in manufacturing process documentation.  
I will provide you with a video of a live product build in a manufacturing environment.  
Your task is to watch the video carefully and produce a complete, detailed Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) in JSON format, ready for operator use, with no follow-up clarifications required.

**STRICT JSON SCHEMA**  
The output must exactly match the following JSON Schema:

**SOP CREATION RULES**  

**Step Breakdown:**  
- Identify all discrete build steps from the video.  
- Each step must be one single action starting with a strong verb (Insert, Tighten, Verify, Connect).  
- Do not combine multiple actions in one step.  

**Timestamps:**  
- "Start" and "End" times must be in MM:SS format.  
- Use exact moments from the video (no approximations).  

**Tools and Materials:**  
- Each step’s "Tools and Materials" array must list all items used in that step.  
- Every item entry must include Category, Part Number/Specification, Description, and Quantity exactly as visible in the video.  

**Procedure:**  
- Use concise, operator-ready, action-oriented language.  
- Each string in "Procedure" must represent a single atomic action.  
- No placeholders or “TBD” values—every instruction must come from the video.  

**Image Suggestions:**  
- Provide one or more MM:SS timestamps per step under "Image Suggestions" for high-resolution still captures.  
- Include the midpoint timestamp of the step and any other key frames that improve clarity.  

**Quality Checks:**  
- List all inspection and verification steps visible in the video, including measurable criteria (e.g., torque values, dimension tolerances, pass/fail thresholds).  
- Use exact values shown in the video where available.  

**Initial Setup:**  
- "Initial Setup: Required Tools and Materials" must list all items required before starting the build (tools, parts, fixtures, PPE if visible).  

**Strict Structure & Style:**  
- Output must be valid JSON matching the schema exactly.  
- Field names must match the schema (capitalization and punctuation included).  
- No extra top-level fields. No markdown or commentary inside the JSON.  
- Use exact part numbers, measurements, and torque values as seen or stated in the video.

**VALIDATION SAFEGUARD**  
Before returning the output:  
1. **Schema Validation:** Validate the generated JSON against the provided JSON Schema (draft-07).  
2. **Automatic Correction:** If any validation errors are detected, automatically correct them (fix data types, required fields, timestamp formats, missing arrays, invalid quantities, etc.) and re-validate. Corrections must preserve factual values from the video — do not invent part numbers or values. If a missing required field is truly not present in the video, populate it with the most specific observable value; if nothing observable exists, fail the generation (see step 4).  
3. **Re-validate:** Repeat correction and validation until there are zero schema errors.  
4. **Fail-safe:** If the JSON cannot be corrected without inventing values, return a single JSON object that includes an additional top-level required field "Errors" (array of strings) describing what cannot be filled from the video. This "Errors" field is allowed only when factual data is missing and cannot be derived; otherwise it must not appear. Example:  
   \`\`\`json
   { "Initial Setup: Required Tools and Materials": [...], "Steps": [...], "Errors": ["Missing torque value for Step 3 — not visible in video"] }
   \`\`\`
5. **Final Output**: Only return the final JSON once it passes schema validation (or includes "Errors" as described). The final output must be pure JSON — no commentary, no markdown, no additional text.


**DELIVERABLE**  
When I provide the video:

- Produce a single JSON object that matches the schema exactly (or includes "Errors" when unavoidable).  
- All values must be derived from the video — no placeholders or invented part numbers.  
- All step timestamps must be MM:SS.  
- Each step must contain one atomic action written as an action verb phrase.  
- Include "Image Suggestions" timestamps (midpoint + key frames) for each step.  
- Include "Quality Checks" with explicit pass/fail criteria and measurable values when visible (e.g., torque in Nm, voltages, dimensions).  
- Validate and auto-correct the JSON until it passes schema checks before returning.  
- Return only the JSON object (pure JSON). No additional commentary.`
